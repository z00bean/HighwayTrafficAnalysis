# Research on Truck Rollover Crashes at Highway Ramps

## Introduction

Highway ramps often witness truck rollover crashes, causing significant congestion and roadblocks. This research aimed to understand the primary causes of these incidents, utilizing drones to collect traffic videos at seven high-risk ramps in Massachusetts. The study includes the development of a model for vehicle detection and various algorithms for tracking vehicles, extracting trajectories, and identifying high-risk events such as unsafe lane changes.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Drones were employed to gather traffic videos at seven identified high-risk ramps.
   - Developed a model for vehicle detection using advanced algorithms.

2. **Analysis:**
   - Extracted vehicle trajectories and identified high-risk events, including last-minute lane changes.
   - Reviewed crash narratives from January 2015 to February 2022 for all ramp truck rollovers in Massachusetts.

3. **Infrastructure Investigation:**
   - Examined the locations, types of traffic signs, slopes, and curve radii of the seven identified ramps.

## Findings

1. **Crash Characteristics:**
   - Over 95% of ramp truck rollovers were identified as single-vehicle crashes.
   - Speeding emerged as the predominant cause.

2. **Safety Improvement Recommendations:**
   - Provided practical and specific safety improvement recommendations based on the analysis.
